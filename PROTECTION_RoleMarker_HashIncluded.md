# PROTECTION.md ‚Äì Structural Protection Notice (U-Type-001 Role Marker)

This document defines the strategic protection model applied to the Role Marker module  
within the U-Type-001 command interface structure.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Purpose of Protection

The Role Marker system is designed to modularize and control GPT output structure.  
Due to its potential for misuse in prompt chaining, GPT automation, or system-level injection,  
its execution is restricted to ensure:

- Structural integrity preservation  
- Controlled research environments  
- Prevention of unauthorized commercial or derivative use  
- Contribution-based evaluation for conditional access

## üîí Protection Strategy

| Layer | Protection Type | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Execution | Blocked | GPT-based execution (chat/API/plugin) is not allowed |
| Modification | Prohibited | Structural edits, derivations, and extensions are disallowed |
| Commercial Use | Restricted | Requires contract with the author |
| Visibility | Public | Source is viewable for analysis only |
| Contribution Use | Conditional | Requires prior explicit approval based on value demonstrated |
