# U-Type-001-RoleMarker-LicenseLocked

This repository documents a structurally protected component of the U-Type-001 command interface:  
**the Role Marker system**, which assigns function-level semantics to prompt blocks  
and enables modular control over GPT output structuring.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **License-Locked Structure Notice**  
> This repository contains a **non-executable structural interface** of the U-Type-001 Role Marker system.  
> Public visibility does **not imply usage permission**.  
> **Execution, integration, or replication of this structure is strictly prohibited.**

## üß© What is This?

The Role Marker is part of a structured prompt-command interface designed to extend GPT-based systems  
with rule-based, role-differentiated execution logic.  
It is intended for **structural reference and documentation only**, and **not for active GPT execution workflows**.

---

## üö´ Usage Restrictions

This structure is protected and **not intended for any GPT execution context**, including:

- Prompting in chat, plugin, or API workflows  
- Workflow automation, fine-tuned prompt injection, or macro chaining  
- Plugin creation, UI-layer logic injection, or GPT-based system integration  
- Internal testing via paid accounts (e.g., ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise tiers)  
- Derivative implementation, distribution, or model-adaptive replication
